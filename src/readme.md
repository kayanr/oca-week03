Create a interface called Vehicle
A public method called Move which takes in a parameter of Float called distance, and returns a Float
Create a class called BMW which extends Vehicle
A static variable called brand of type string.
A instance variable called model of type string.
A instance variable called year of type Date.

changeDirection that takes the input parameter of a String called direction
Stop
Accelerate that takes the input of float called speed
Decelerate that takes the input of float called speed
Update BWM to the new interface
3 create New Classes that extends vehicle
Bicycle
MotorCycle
UniCycle

Step 03
Create an Interface called Driver
The interface has a method called drive that takes the parameter of a vehicle
Create an Class called DeliveryGuy that implements Driver
This class should have a static field called Company of type String
